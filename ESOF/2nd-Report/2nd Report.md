## Outside Development
As stated in their website, the Cozy developers clearly instate that they intend for cozy to also work as a web development learning tool. This way they allow for users who whish to develop to reuse the data already stored in the Cozy, they also want users to take the code apart, study it and "hack it to your heart's content." By allowing data reuse they what people to build new services on top of the user's data. The user's developed apps can then be introduced to the Cozy communityso that feedback is given and the product improved. But nowere is it stated that the "external projects" can enter the main app functions. A question about this has been sent to the developers.
