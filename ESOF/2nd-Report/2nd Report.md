## Requirements: Introduction, Purpose/Scope, and Description
Requirements engineeing is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining requirements taking into accont user and client needs in order to arrive at a definition of system, hardware or software requirements in order to respond to those needs. According to Barry Boehm requirements are "designing the right thing" as opposed to software engineering’s "designing the thing right"(Boehm, 1981).
When it comes to Scoping requirements frequently start with only one idea of the project. This happens because clients don't often know exacty what they want and usualy have limited knowledge about what they are asking. Scoping is iterative as the product's functions become clear and more realistic as time goes on and understanding increases between the clients and the developers.

## Outside Development
As stated in their website, the Cozy developers clearly instate that they intend for cozy to also work as a web development learning tool. This way they allow for users who whish to develop to reuse the data already stored in the Cozy, they also want users to take the code apart, study it and "hack it to your heart's content." By allowing data reuse they what people to build new services on top of the user's data. The user's developed apps can then be introduced to the Cozy communityso that feedback is given and the product improved. But nowere is it stated that the "external projects" can enter the main app functions. A question about this has been sent to the developers.
Besides having open source code and insisting on having users "toying" with their code deveoping for themselves Cozy also has a mentorship program to help building personal apps. Topics covered by the mentorship are: code training, debugging or improving the design of user's apps. Cozy is a perfect platform for learning Node.js, Express.js, React.js and Angular JS and how these frameworks are used in real-word software development.
