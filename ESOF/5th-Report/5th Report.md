The Project had a Compliance evaluation of 3 out of 10.
Only the "Keep Architecture Components Balanced", "Keep Your Codebase Small" and "Write Clean Code" points were fulfilled.

As we have previously stated the Cozy team uses Agile methods as their development process. Not only the initial development followed theses methods but also these methods are implemented as the project needs maintability. 

The Cozy Project is very complex and far from being completed. That is why this system requires high evolution. In the previous report we talked about Validation and Verification, now we will talk about what must be done to keep the system running.

Updating the software is inevitable, new requirements emerge, the business environment change, erros, bugs, more equipements, performence issues, etc. There is no way a system will never need an upgrade. In the case of cozy photos there is still a lot of bugs and some enhancments that can be done. This app, competing with other top market ones, must keep updated in order to enter competition.

The truth is that is is not always easy to keep these upgrades. There are many factors that may compromise the evolution of a system. One of them is the initial requierments and the predicted costs. To maintain a system it is very often to require aditional and unpredicted funding. The goog thing is that cozy is not a Lagacy system yet. This means the software is still easy to modify. This can save some significant time and funding. While the Team still sticks to the original formation internal Forward Engineering is easy. There is no need for Reengineering the System for now.

As we stated in the previous assigment, Cozy is an open source project, which means there is a great contribution from the comunnity. The only problem is the Reverse Engineering that needs to be done in order to help improve the project that might take a while. 

Sometimes to evolve the software there might have to be a new interpretation in the Requirements, Architecture, Design, Test Cases and Traceability. This is something that outside people can not do. That is why big Project changes are done internally while small changes can be done outside.

The Cozy Photos Project is very complex and to be fully integrated with the project might take some months. That is why helping solving bugs or help enhance a future might be complicated in this Project.

Cozy Photos Github not only has a Bug Section but still has a Enhancements Section (another advantage of having open Source Projects),
this helps maintain Project evolution more controlled. By regularly keeping up to date with the Customer needs the System will not need drasctic changes for a few Time. 

Bellow we take a possible enhancment for Cozy Photos proposed in the Forum Section and we describe how it really is a possible enhancement in the Project Contex.
