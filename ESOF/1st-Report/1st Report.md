# Development Process

## Development Process Description and History

As stated in the Assignment we needed to know more about the development process of the Project. 
Given that, we created a new Forum Thread where we asked the developers for information regarding this matter.
In a matter of a day they successfully answered.

Link to the Thread Page with the response: https://forum.cozy.io/t/development-process/3539

The first fact stated was about the multiple development processes.
As the project was in development multiple different approaches were implemented.
It was almost impossible to stick to one simple development process to the end. So the team had to further discuss new methods of development. For example, the week were we contacted the developers they were about to implement a new run!

It is also stated that there is a very good consistency regarding the first ideas and the management process. The results are very straightforward with the initial concepts.

As it was to expect from this kind of plan, the team has two big project supervisors (Two Bosses) and around 25 people distributed by self-organized teams, that collaborate together. Of course something like this is very important to keep consistency in the company.

We also asked for a little bit of history around the team to better understand the organization implied.

The project started around 4 to 5 years ago where both future co-founders had the idea of
> a more open and decentralized web, a web where privacy can be used to leverage a huge value for the users through new services and features

Both founders founded the company by the end of 2012 and started recruiting interns. Some stopped being just interns and are still in the company with a well-deserved job. It all expanded from there. The company was able to raise money and started recruiting more people which lead to the team that is around the project nowadays.

An important information was added regarding the last development process used: Scrum in Agile. Will be later covered.

### Impressions and Description of Cozy Photos Platform
Cozy Photos is a small cloud platform to create albums of photos that you can share between friends.
The Interface is very User-Friendly and not to Graphical heavy, which helps to have a more intuitive interaction with new Users.
It is structured in Albums and it is possible to "Drag N' Drop" photos on any album or manually upload. 
Each Album includes a title and a small description of the content and it is possible to edit this values any time.
The Share option is still Primitive for it is only possible to share through email.

The developers did not advance much more information regarding the first development processes they used. So we decided to simulate what would it be like if the Project had been supervised under some 3 different Processes.

It is important to know:
- Team with 25+ elements
- Distributed into other small groups

### Common Process
The common Process is designed in 4 different parts
- Software Specification
- Software Design and Implementation
- Software Validation
- Software Evolution

The first part is when everyone gathers together to find what they really need and what will they implement. In a more common case it this step would have been made with the client. However, the developers are their own clients, along with the rest of the world. So there is a 'freer' willing end. 
Once the goal is set. Small teams are going to be created and designated to different tasks. This provides a more efficient development process rather than the whole team concentrated with a task at a time. After a long time, it is time for Step 3, which consists in fixing numerous issues and validate the final product to know if it corresponds to the first concepts and ideas.
If there is a mutual consensus whether the project can finally be launched in the market, it goes directly to step 4. Launching the product and start a strict and constant supervision and evolution.


Pros:
- A process that might work with small projects
- Might work if there is a good feedback and help from the community
- Can work if the developing team is small and open for constant discussion

Cons:
- Too much time consuming and unpredicted additional costs if something is out of the project initial concept in the final steps
- Might lead to an elevated cost at the end if a task is not on schedule


### Waterfall Process
Using the Waterfall mode, the team needs to been open and ready to new changes every time.
This process has 5 principal topics that need cover-up
- Requirements Definition
- System and Software Design
- Implementation and unit testing
- Integration and System Testing 
- Operation and Maintenance

The main difference between this method and the common method is the ability to be more recursive. At the end of each step there is no prohibition to go back to previous steps. This system is very compatible with changes.
Let us assume that the team already has the concept very well consolidated between everyone. It is time to define the requirements needed. This step can be often visited given the project concept might be changing frequently. For example, if the team is new in the market, they will put the concept to be tested in the. No one can tell if the first, middle or final ideas will actually sell! So the team must be ready for requirements redefinition at any time in the Development Process. Okay. Let us assume the team as an idea for now. It is time to start the planning time and to start the small implementations. The Development in this state must be done in small tasks and unitary tests. If everything goes well, they could skip to the next step which is where every partition of the project comes together to create a big one. There, the system tests will show small bugs, incompatibilities and unfinished tasks. Although this step might show how poor quality the application is, it still can save a lot of money and time. This model is also very effective if there is incremental development and delivery. A frequent supervision among every small task and constant delivery even though the unfinished state might actually save money and time because the concept and ideas are still on schedule to be changed. 
Finally, it is time to deliver the product and be ready for constant maintenance.

Pros:
- Works better with larger projects where the system is being developed in multiple sites
- Open to changes
- Lower risk of overall project failure

Cons: 
- Constant changes might lead to a more time and money consuming
- Works better if requirements well-understood and changes will be fairly limited

### Boehm's Spiral Model
The main feature in this model is the spiral representation. The concept "go back" does not exist here unlike the Waterfall mode.
The project is developed in a continuous loop where the develop states will be repeated in the future. Below are enumerated the different phases of the Boehm's spiral model:
1. Specific objectives for the phase are identified
2. Risks are assessed and put in place to reduce the key risks
3. A development model for the system is chosen which can be any of the generic models
4. The project is reviewed and the next phase of the spiral is planned

The project starts in phase 1, goes all the way to phase 4 through 2 and 3, and starts again in phase 1.
Let us consider the team wants to use this Model. The first thing to do is to lift the requirements and prepare the life-cycle plan. 
Next thing, review and perfect everything. Later, start a controlled analysis of possible risks and the develop the first prototype. 
At the third step, simulations, models and benchmarks need to be put to test. The development plan comes along and the loop restarts now although a little bit different this time. Now that every security risk was validated, the team can finally start the project itself.
For that, they will determine next objectives, analyze the risks, start a new prototype, create simulations and benchmarks, point out all the requirements, initiate the development plan, more analysis and prototypes and finally start the design and so on.
This process is auto-repetitive. Although the numerous security parameters and risk analysis it helps provide a better overall quality in the process and prevent eventual unexpected additional costs.

Pros:
- Very Good in terms of planning
- Might help whit big projects or risky projects

Cons: 
- To many useless intermediate steps in some cases
- Projects with too many members might create disorganization

### Scrum Process flow - Used in a second part of the Project Process
The idea behind Scrum is to focus on the delivery in the shortest time possible, constantly realizing new features with as most feedback as possible, focusing on the best ideas and discussing with very high frequency between the developers.

The team gathered together and discussed the priority list of features to be developed. Later they organized themselves in smaller tasks and groups.
They performed their Sprints in 1 week and every 24 hours there would be a meeting for debriefing and discussing the state of work.
New functionalities were always coming regularly implying they probably used more Agile processes in the mean-time.

## Opinions, Critics and Alternatives

### Analyzing the Repository and General Activity
There is a huge Branching process in the overall. Small tasks are branched from master and a few weeks later are merged with the master.
Normally up to 2 or 3 branches are simultaneously in development. 

The first (v1.0.0) version was launched in March 2014. Before launch they had 5 active branches working simultaneously.
A newer (v1.0.2) version was launched in June of the same year with 4 branches. Same with the next version (v1.0.3) where it was launched 3 months later with 3 active branches. 
From then on the next version was only launched a year later (v1.0.4) not adding significant new features. The following process changed a little. They opted for another process where they would give more updates in small time intervals. The version v1.0.5 arrived in January of 2015 bringing some significant differences. Before that release they add up to 5 different tasks simultaneously. From then on periodically updates were released with an interval of 1, 2 or 3 months. From January 2015 to June 2015 they gradually updated from v1.0.5 to v1.0.14 with an estimate of 1.5 version updates per month and approximate 3 branches working. Another low passed development was taken from then. Only introduction a new version 5 months later in November. From then on the project was updated every 2 months having 3 to 5 branches working simultaneously.

According to the Graphs from Github. The major concentration of work was placed in the first 7 months.

### Analyzing the Code
The project code is quite difficult to analyze given the strong connection with the server partition which we are not covering.
The first impressions revealed a very difficult to understand code. We didn't give much effort to understand it completely now because there were other priorities in place and the obvious difficulty of the code.

### Cozy Forum
The Cozy developers use their forum (forum.cozy.io) as their real time communication device. The forum is used to announce future plans, decisions made during scrums, asking for external help and also helping newcommers to start developing parts of the app. The forum is used in english, french and german having the primary page the  channels: Announcement, Support, Discuss, FAQ, Security, Français (French), Deutsch (German) and ISEN. The only problem we came across when analysing the forum was that we noticed that sometimes the information wasn't shared between languages, ex.: on one topic in french one of the developers takled about some of the future plans for the devepment of the app, that information in particular wasn't found in english in any place on the forum. 

### Critical Analysis
Although we weren't able to retrieve much more additional information about the first processes used we believe the project was developed strongly following Agile methods. Which is probably the best method to use in this case. The wide efficiency methods defined through Agile always helps in projects like this. With huge dependencies in the project, the urge to deliver new features as fast as possible and the need to communicate every day to prioritize next steps are just some of the reasons why this project probably was using Agile methods since the beginning. 

### Objectives
We believe that the idea behind the whole project is deliver a new experience to the clients as fast as possible and according to the constructive feedback, improve the experience, resolve bugs and implement new features. The project is also trying to create an alternative to the major online file sharing and storage services, including the user's personal photos by allowing the user's to run the app on their own servers. Making this way a safer way for users to store their information online.

### Conclusions
We all agree that probably the whole development process used was Agile, Scrum. Due to its flexibility to use in this sort of projects it is essential to have a method like this if we want efficient and fast results.
