# Project Description - [Cozy Photos](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-photos)

Cozy Photos is an easy to use app made to backup and share your photos with friends and family. It let's you add your personal photos and organize them in folders and albums in a matter of minutes, but also share it with friends or the entire world.

As stated in the [Cozy Photos](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-photos) repository:
> Cozy Photos makes your photo management easy. Main features are:
> - Simple UI
> - Photo upload
> - Galleries
> - Gallery Sharing

# Development Process

## Development Process Description

As stated in the Assignment we needed to know more about the development process of the Project. 
Given that, we created a new Forum Thread where we asked the developers for informaton regarding this matter.
In a matter of a day they successfully answered.

Link to the Thread Page with the response: https://forum.cozy.io/t/development-process/3539

The first fact stated was about the multiple development processes.
As the project was in development multiple differente aproaches were implemented.
It was almost impossible to stick to one simple development process to the end. So the team had to further discuss new methods of development. For example, the week were we contacted the developers they were about to implement a new run!

It is also stated that there is a very good consistency regarding the first ideas and the managment process. The results are very straightforward with the initial concepts.

As it was to expect from this kind of plan, the team has two big project supervisors (Two Bosses) and around 25 people distributed by self-organized teams, that collaborate together. Of course something like this is very important to keep consistency in the company.

We also asked for a little bit of history around the team to better understand the organization implied.

The project started around 4 to 5 years ago where both future co-founders had the idea of
> a more open and decentralized web, a web where privacy can be used to leverage a huge value for the users through new services and features

Both founders founded the company by the end of 2012 and started recruiting interns. Some stopped being just interns and are still in the company with a well deserved job. It all expanded from there. The company was able to raise money and started recruiting more people which lead to the team that is around the project nowadays.

## Opinions, Critics and Alternatives

### Impressions and Description of Cozy Photos Platform
Cozy Photos is a small cloud platform to create albums of photos that you can share between friends.
The Inferface is very User-Frinedly and not to Graphical heavy, which helps to have a more intuitive interaction with new Users.
It is structered in Albums and it is possible to "Drag N' Drop" photos on any album or manually upload. 
Each Album includes a title and a small description of the content and it is possible to edit this values any time.
The Share option is still Primitive for it is only possible to share through email.

The developers did not advanced much more information regarding the development processes. So the team decided to simulate what would it be like if the Project had been supervised under different Processes.
It is important to know:
- Team with 25+ elements
- Distributted into other small groups

### Common Process
The common Process is designed in 4 different parts.
- Software Specification
- Software Design and Implementation
- Software Validation
- Software Evolution

The first part is when everyone gathers together to find what they really need and what will they implement. In a more common case it this step would have been made with the client. However the developers are their own clients, along with the rest of the world. So there is a more free willing end. 
Once the goal is set. Small teams are going to be created and designated to different tasks. This provides a more efficient development process rather than the hole team concetrated with a task at a time. After a long time it is time for Step 3. Consisting in fixing numerous issues and validate the final product to know if it correspondes to the first concepts and ideas.
If there is a mutual consensus wheter the project can finally be launched in the market. It goes directily into step 4. Launching the product and start a strict and constant supervision and evolution.


Pros:
- A process that might work with small projects.
- Might work if there is a good feedback and help from the community.
- Can work if the developing team is small and open for constant discussion.

Cons:
- Too much time consuming and unpredicted aditional costs if something is out of the project intial concept in the final steps. 
- Might lead to an elevated cost at the end if a task is not on schedule.


### Waterfall Process
Using the Waterfall mode the team nedds to been open and ready to new changes everytime.
This process has 5 principal topics that need cover-up.

- Requirements Definition
- System and Software Design
- Implementation and unit testing
- Integration and System Testing 
- Operation and Maintenance

The main difference between this method and the common method is the ability to be more recursive. At the end of each step there is no prohibition to go back to previous steps. This system is very compatible with changes.
Let us assume that the team already has the concept very well consolidated between everyone. It is time to define the requierments needed. This step can be often visited given the project concept might be changing frequently. For example if the team is new in the market, they will put the concept to be tested in the. No one can tell if the first, middle or final ideas will actually sell! So the team must be ready for requierments redefinition at any time in the Development Process. Okay. Let us assume the team as an idea for now. It is time to start the planning time and to start the small implementations. The Development in this state must be done in small tasks and unitary tests. If everything goes well, they could skip to the next step which is where every partition of the project comes together to create a big one. There, the system tests will show small bugs, incompatibilities and unfinished tasks. Altough this step might show how poor quality the application is, it still can save a lot of money and time. This model is also very effective if there is incremental development and delivery. A frequent supervision among every small task and constant delivery even though the unfinished state might actually save money and time because the concept and ideas are still on schedule to be changed. 
Finally it is time to deliver the product and be ready for constant maintenance.

Pros:
- Works better with larger projects where the system is develop in multiple sites
- Open to changes
- Lower risk of overall project failure

Cons: 
- Constant changes might lead to a more time and money consuming
- Works better if requierments well-understood and changes will be fairly limited

### Boehm's Spiral Model
The main feature in this model is the spiral representation. The concept "go back" does not exist here unlike the Waterfall mode.
The project is developed in a continuous loop where the develop states will be repeted in the future. Bellow are enumerated the different phases of the Boehm's spiral model:

1. Specific objectives for the phase are identified.
2. Risks are assessed and put in place to reduce the key risks.
3. A development model for the system is chosen which can be any of the generic models.
4. The project is reviewed and next phase of the spiral is planned.

The project starts in phase 1, goes all the way to step 4 through 2 and 3, and starts again in step 1.
Let us consider the team wants to use this Model. The first thing to do is to lift the requierments and prepare the life-cycle plan. 
Next thing, review and perfect everything. Later, start a controled analysis of possible risks and the develop the first prototype. 
At the third step, simulations, models and benchmarks need to be put to test. The development plan comes along and the loop restarts now although a little bit different this time. Now that every security risk was validated, the team can finally start the project itself.
For that, they will determine next objectives, analyze the risks, start a new prototype, create simulations and benchamarks, point out all the requierments, initiate the development plan, more analysis and prototypes and finally start the design. 
This process
