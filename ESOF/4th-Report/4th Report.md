# 4th Report

## Discuss Software Testability and Reviews
The Software Verification and Validation step is of extreme importace in software engineering. From providing multiple case tests and ensuring the safety and coherence of our system we are able to provide a favorable and safe experencie. Sometimes even saving human lives!

In this part of the Assignment we will discuss a bit about Softwares Validation and Verification.

It is true that the system we are studying is really complex and big. Solving a problem or a bug may need requiere unplanned funds to proceed. So how do we control the existence of problems/bugs? How do we optimize review time? 

The problems in Verification are not about the lack of methods. There are many ways to proceed a project Verification. Most times depends on the reviewr. The reviewer must always try to see which methods he is most familiarized with. Altough in some cases it is a team that will perform the verification, in this situation the team must discuss which methods must be used, because in some cases it depends on the context of the project or in some cases in depends on the internal functioning of the team. Or even both!

A way to review code is for example through checklists. A checklist helps make the review more effective and efficient, by focusing
the attention on the most frequent and important problems. In the contex of this project it might help in individual reviewing. 

Another way to review code is using peer to perr review or even intercalated peer to peer between a team. This methods consist in exchanging code or/and reviews between programmers. This helps checking errors more quickly. Of course that for this there must be good an efficient communication. And for that each coder must check that if their work is easily reviewable. Improving efficience naturally.
This methods not only optimize time but it also helps to control and to observe the overhall state of the project, leading to a more reasonable and organized system.
