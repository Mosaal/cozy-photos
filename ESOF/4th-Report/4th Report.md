# 4th Report

## Discuss Software Testability and Reviews
The Software Verification and Validation step is of extreme importace in software engineering. From providing multiple case tests and ensuring the safety and coherence of our system we are able to provide a favorable and safe experencie. Sometimes even saving human lives.
In this part of the Assignment we will discuss a bit about Softwares Validation and Verification.
It is true that the system we are studying is really complex and big. Bug solving and reviews may need more funds to proceed. Which might not be part of the initial project planning.
So how do we control the existence of problems/bugs? How do we optimize review time? 
There are many ways actually. The reviewer must always try to see which ones he is most familiarized with. Altough in some cases it is a team that will perform the verification, in this situation the team must discuss which methods must be used, because in some cases it depends on the context of the project or in some cases in depends on the internal functioning of the team. Or even both!
